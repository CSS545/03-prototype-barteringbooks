This is an updated version of the final project. Recommend typing **npm i**, **expo start** and scanning the QR code using the expo app on a cellphone to use.

Users will be able to choose the used book they want to donate or sell at a lower price from the category, set up the name of the book, price, provide a brief description, and upload images.

State management has been taken into consideration. When the user uploads their book or type description, they can navigate away from the app or pick up a phone call and continue their work without starting all over again.

Image uploading behaves differently in the simulator but works perfectly in a physical device. It can be achieved by typing **expo start** and scanning the QR code using the expo app on a cellphone.
