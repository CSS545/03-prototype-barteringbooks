# Team: Karan Bhatt, Sheng Wang

The MVP is designed for our target demographic since it is clean, simple, and without unnecessary layouts. Target users will complete their task(in this case, donate/exchange/sell used books at a lower price) in a minimum amount of time and effort. Given that it is an educational-related app, our users will not have to waste time looking around.

· Search section will let user search the book name of they need, the search can be based on genres and some criteria like donate, exchange, re-sell.

· The most popular section would let users see what books are other people trying to get the most.

. The profile section will give the details related to the number of connections, total number of contributions, etc.

· The recent section is made to inform users what are the most recent requests.

· Along with the most popular/ recent are the sorting features which users will be able to sort the listings by time or price.

# Feature always yields value. In our app, we don't have extra features. All the features are aligned with the values listed below.
a) Strive to provide educational opportunities to as many people as possible by making books free / affordable.
  - With the help of donate/exchange/re-sell feature the above value can be delivered.

b) Passing the sense of community: Users tend to be educational-related, potentially providing a platform to make friends or mentors.
  - By the feature of connecting with other people, communicating and sharing the information related to books can achieve this value.

c) Global recognition: The app can be delivered to countries outside of the United States without legal issues, making it possible to earn global credit, passing the positive value to even more places.
 - By using the feature of location, people anyware can see the books that are posted and can narrow down or broaden up their search.
